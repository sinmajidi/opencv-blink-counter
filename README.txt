this is a real blink detection,you can use it for several aim.
at the first project that is named blink.py i try to detect right eye and make the diagram of right eye movment.
notice that the program can detect eyelid not pupil.
at the second perogram that named sleepDetection.py i try to make a program that can detect the eye open or close,if eye become close for 30 frame program findout the person is sleeping.
